# Fault injection

> Fault injection is a testing technique which aids in understanding how a [virtual/real] system behaves when stressed in unusual ways.[1] This technique is based on simulation's or experiment's result, thus it may be more valid (or closer to reality) compared to statistical methods. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fault_injection)]


## Why 

In software testing, fault injection is a technique for improving the coverage of a test by introducing faults to test code paths, in particular error handling code paths, that might otherwise rarely be followed. It is often used with stress testing and is widely considered to be an important part of developing **robust** software.

## What 

Fault injection is a **testing** technique which aids in understanding how a [virtual/real] system behaves when **stressed** in unusual ways. This technique is based on simulation's or experiment's result, thus it may be more **valid** (or closer to reality) compared to statistical methods.
