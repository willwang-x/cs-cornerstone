## What 

Scrum is an **agile framework** for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who **break their work** into goals that can be completed within **timeboxed iterations**, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly **two weeks**. The Scrum Team track progress in **15-minute time-boxed daily meetings**, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds **sprint review**, to demonstrate the work done, and sprint retrospective to continuously improve.

* **Agile**: In software development, agile practices approach discovering requirements and developing solutions through the **collaborative effort** of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It **advocates** adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages flexible responses to change.
