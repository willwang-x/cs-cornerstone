## What 

### overview

In project management, a task is an **activity** that needs to be **accomplished** within a defined **period** of time or by a **deadline** to work towards **work-related goals**. 

It is a small essential piece of a job that serves as a means to **differentiate** various components of a project. 

* A task can be broken down into **assignments** which should also have a defined start and end date or a **deadline** for **completion**. 
* One or more assignments on a task puts the task **under execution**.
* **Completion** of all assignments on a specific task normally renders the task **completed**. 
* Tasks can be linked together to create *dependencies*.


### suffer 

In most projects, tasks may suffer one of two major drawbacks:

* **Task dependency**: Which is normal as most tasks rely on others to get done. However, this can lead to the stagnation of a project when many tasks cannot get started unless others are finished.
* **Unclear understanding of the term complete**: For example, if a task is 90% complete, does this mean that it will take only 1/9 of the time already spent on this task to finish it? Although this is mathematically sound, it is rarely the case when it comes to practice.

### [life cycle](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Task_management#/Task_life_cycle)

* Ready
