# A Good Project README 


## Why 

> Project README flies are typically an after thought in the software development process. If a question comes up repeatedly it gets added in an unstructured fashion. This is unfortunate, because the people who need READMEs the most are new engineers who joining the team. They don’t know any of the team’s **jargon**. They probably don’t have a good understanding of what the project does. And they probably don’t understand the internal architecture of the project.

Because no one can read your mind (yet) 

It's an easy way to answer questions that your audience will likely have regarding how to install and use your project and also how to collaborate with you.

	* What are our asynchronous tasks?
	* What patterns do we use in our codebase? 
	* Explain any unusual patterns you use and why you need them.
* **How to get builds running**
	* What tools are needed to run builds?
	* What build commands and flags should a new engineer be using?
* **How to get Tests running**
	* What tools to use to run unit/functional/integration/end-to-end tests
