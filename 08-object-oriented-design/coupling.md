# Coupling

> Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured computer system and a good design, and when combined with high cohesion, supports the general goals of high readability and maintainability. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Coupling_(computer_programming))]

## Why 

The software quality metrics of coupling and cohesion were invented by Larry Constantine in the late 1960s as part of a structured design, based on characteristics of “good” programming practices that reduced maintenance and modification costs.

## What

In software engineering, **coupling** is the degree of interdependence between software modules; **a measure of how closely connected two routines or modules are**; the strength of the relationships between modules.

**Coupling is usually contrasted with cohesion**. Low coupling often correlates with high cohesion, and vice versa. Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured computer system and a good design, and when combined with high cohesion, supports the general goals of high readability and maintainability.

* **Intuition**: 你买了个台灯，装的白炽灯，后来你把白炽灯拧下来换了个**欧普**的螺旋状节能灯，后来又换了个**飞利浦**的管型节能灯。这就是灯罩和灯解耦了。程序中的低耦合是指各模块相对独立，对某个**模块内部的修改**不影响**其他模块**。<br> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jXHLoPs.jpg" alt="decoupling" width="150"/>
