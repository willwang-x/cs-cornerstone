# Coupling

> Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured computer system and a good design, and when combined with high cohesion, supports the general goals of high readability and maintainability.

## Why 

The software quality metrics of coupling and cohesion were invented by Larry Constantine in the late 1960s as part of a structured design, based on characteristics of **“good” programming practices that reduced maintenance and modification costs. **

## What

In software engineering, **coupling** is the degree of interdependence between software modules; **a measure of how closely connected two routines or modules are**; the strength of the relationships between modules.

## Q&A

* How many types of coupling?
* What are disadvantages of tight coupling?
* How to decrease coupling?
* Coupling versus cohesion?
