## Why 

Cohesion is an ordinal type of measurement and is usually described as “high cohesion” or “low cohesion”. 

* Modules with high cohesion tend to be preferable, because high cohesion is associated with several desirable traits of software including **robustness**, **reliability**, **reusability**, and **understandability**. 
* In contrast, low cohesion is associated with undesirable traits such as being difficult to maintain, test, reuse, or even understand.

## What 

Cohesion metrics measure **how well the methods of a class are related to each other**. A cohesive class performs one function. A non-cohesive class performs two or more unrelated functions. A non-cohesive class may need to be restructured into two or more smaller classes.
