- **metaphor** boxes e.g. anger


## Why

MEDAL is an advanced learner’s dictionary and shares most of the features of this type of dictionary: it provides definitions in simple language, using a **controlled defining vocabulary**; most words have example sentences to illustrate how they are **typically used**; and information is given about how words combine **grammatically** or **in collocations**. MEDAL also introduced a number of innovations. These include:

* ‘**collocation boxes**’ giving lists of **high-frequency** collocates, identified using Sketch Engine software
* word **frequency information**, with the most frequent **7500** English words shown in red and categorised in **three frequency bands**, based on the idea, derived from Zipf's law, that a relatively small number of high-frequency words account for a high percentage of most texts ‘**metaphor boxes**’, showing how the vocabulary used for expressing common concepts (such as ‘anger’) tends to reflect a common metaphorical framework. This is based on George Lakoff’s ideas of conceptual metaphor
* a **50-page section** providing guidance on writing academic English, based on a collaboration with the Centre for English Corpus Linguistics in Louvain, Belgium and using the Centre’s learner corpus data[6]


Terms:

* **Sketch Engine**: a corpus manager and text analysis software aiming to enable people studying **language behaviour** (lexicographers, researchers in corpus linguistics, translators or language learners) to search large text collections according to complex and linguistically motivated queries. 
* **Zipf's law**: an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics that refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions.
* **Conceptual metaphor**: refers to the **understanding of one idea, or conceptual domain, in terms of another**. An example of this is the understanding of quantity in terms of directionality (e.g. "the price of peace is rising") or the understanding of time in terms of money (e.g. "I spent time at work today").
