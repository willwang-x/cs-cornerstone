Dictionary of Collocation
  <br><br>
</h1>


> In corpus linguistics, a collocation is **a series of words** or terms that co-occur more **often** than would be expected by chance.  In phraseology, collocation is a sub-type of **phraseme**.  [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Collocation)]

## Why

> “It is not so much the words of English nor the grammar of English that makes English difficult … The vague and undefined obstacle to progress … consists for the most part in the existence of so many odd comings-together-of-words.”

An example of a phraseological collocation, as propounded by Michael Halliday, is the expression **strong tea**. While the same meaning could be conveyed by the roughly equivalent **powerful tea**, this expression is considered excessive and awkward by English speakers. Conversely, a corresponding expression in technology, **powerful computer**, is preferred over strong computer.  

Some benefits: 

* avoid overused or ambiguous words like "very", "nice", or "beautiful", by using a pair of words that fit the context better and that have a more **precise** meaning.
* avoid awkward expression since some collocations are fixed, or very strong.
