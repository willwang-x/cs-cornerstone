# English verb

> Verbs constitute one of the main parts of speech (word classes) in the English language. Like other types of words in the language, English verbs are not heavily inflected. Most combinations of tense, aspect, mood and voice are expressed periphrastically, using constructions with auxiliary verbs.  [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/English_verbs)]

## Why


## What 

* [Inflection](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Inflection): In linguistic morphology, inflection (or inflexion) is **a process of word formation**, in which a word is modified to express different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice, aspect, person, number, gender, mood, animacy, and definiteness.
* [Periphrasis](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Periphrasis): In linguistics, periphrasis (/pəˈrɪfrəsɪs/) is **the usage of multiple separate words** to carry the meaning of prefixes, suffixes or verbs, among other things, where either would be possible. 
* [Auxiliary verb](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Auxiliary_verb): An auxiliary verb (abbreviated aux) is a verb that adds functional or grammatical meaning to the clause in which it appears, so as to express tense, aspect, modality, voice, emphasis, etc.  e.g. **Do** you want tea? – do is an auxiliary accompanying the main verb want, used here to form a question – see do-support. 
* [Grammatical tense](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Grammatical_tense): In grammar, tense is a category that expresses time reference.
* [Grammatical aspect](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Grammatical_aspect): Aspect is a grammatical category that expresses how an action, event, or state, denoted by a verb, extends over time. 
* [mood](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Grammatical_mood): In linguistics, grammatical mood (also mode) is a grammatical feature of verbs, used for signalling modality. That is, it is the use of verbal inflections that allow speakers **to express their attitude** toward what they are saying (for example, a statement of fact, of desire, of command, etc.). 
* [voice](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Voice_(grammar)): In grammar, the voice of a verb describes the **relationship** between the **action** (or state) that the verb expresses and the **participants** identified by its arguments (subject, object, etc.).
