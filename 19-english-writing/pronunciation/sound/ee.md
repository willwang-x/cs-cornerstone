The **/i/** is the third most frequently used vowel sound in American English, so pronouncing it correctly is important for your American accent.   

Ok. To make the /i/ sound, you should focus on the correct position of your lips, tongue, and jaw.

* Open your mouth a little, **stretch your lips as wide as you can, and make them tense**. 
* Raise your **tongue** very **high** and push it to the front of your mouth.
* The tip of your tongue should be **lowered** just behind your bottom front teeth.

Remember, the /i/ is a **tense sound**, so your lips and tongue should be tense. Your tongue should be at the front of your mouth.
Let’s try saying it: /i/, /i/, /i/.

By the way, did you know that the /i/ sound is represented by the letter '**e**' in only **15%** of words?  

Most often the /i/ is represented by the letter 'y,' as in "city," followed by the letter 'e,' as in "be" and lastly by the letter 'i,' as in 'ski.'  It’s also often represented by combinations of letters, such as "ea," as in "each," 'ee,' as in "see," and 'ie,' as in "piece."
