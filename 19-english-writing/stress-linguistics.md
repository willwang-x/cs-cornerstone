# Stress

> In linguistics, and particularly phonology, **stress** or accent is relative **emphasis** or prominence given to a certain syllable in a word, or to a certain word in a phrase or sentence.  [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stress_(linguistics))]

## Why 

That emphasis is typically caused by such properties as 

* **increased loudness** and 
* **vowel length**, 
* full **articulation** of the vowel, and 
* **changes** in tone.

## How

There are various ways in which stress manifests itself in the speech stream, and these depend to some extent on which language is being spoken. 

Stressed syllables are often

* louder 
* a higher or lower pitch
* pronounced longer
* a more peripheral articulation


## What 

* **Lexical stress**: or word stress, is the stress placed on a given syllable in a word.
* **Prosodic stress**: or sentence stress, refers to stress patterns that apply at a higher level than the individual word â€“ namely within a prosodic unit.
* **vowel reduction**: In many languages, such as Russian and English, vowel reduction may occur when **a vowel changes from a stressed to an unstressed position**.
