## What 

### Basics

Basic English is an **English-based controlled language** created by linguist and philosopher Charles Kay Ogden as an international auxiliary language, and as an aid for teaching English as a second language. Basic English is, in essence, a **simplified subset of regular English**. It was presented in Ogden's book Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar (1930). 

### History

The first work on Basic English was written by two Englishmen, Ivor Richards, Harvard University, and C.K. Ogden, of the University of Cambridge, England, working in association.
