# in


When one thing is **in** another, it is **surrounded** by or **within** it, the way chocolate chips are in a bowl of cookie batter.

In is a word with many different uses. 

* A child can be in a sandbox, and a teenager can be in love. 
* You can sit in your car, or say to a friend, "See you in an hour!" 
* An actor might be in a film, while your dad tells people he's in publishing, and both live in New York City. 
* If your clothes are in, they're stylish, and if you're locked in your room, you're confined inside it.
