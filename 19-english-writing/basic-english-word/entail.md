To entail is **to involve**. A job at a movie theater might entail sweeping popcorn off the floor, probably because watching a movie entails eating popcorn in the dark. It’s a small price to pay!

The word entail, which comes from Latin, is connected to **the idea of preconditions**. If you want something, you better **figure out what it entails**. 

* If it’s only 8 o’clock and you want to see a movie at 9, that will entail waiting for an hour. 
* If you want to stay out of trouble, that will entail calling your parents and letting them know you're going to be late. That’s what being responsible entails!
