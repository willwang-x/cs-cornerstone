# Speak


To speak is to **talk**. If a UFO lands in your yard, it will be easier to *speak* with the aliens if they've learned how to *speak* English â€” or if you know how to speak Martian.

You can *speak* to your friend about something private, but you can also *speak* at the paleontology enthusiasts' convention, presenting your thoughts on the latest dinosaur discoveries. If you speak Spanish or Hindi, it means you are able to communicate in those languages, and if you *speak* for yourself, it means you offer your own opinions.
