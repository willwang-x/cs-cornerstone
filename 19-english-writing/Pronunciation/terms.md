* **[Syllable](https://www.theschoolrun.com/what-is-a-syllable)**: A syllable is a **single, unbroken sound** of a spoken (or written) word. 
	* Syllables usually contain a vowel and accompanying consonants. Sometimes syllables are referred to as the ‘**beats**’ of spoken language. 
	* The number of times you hear a vowel (a, e, i , o, u) in a word is **equal to the number of syllables a word has**. A good way to identify syllables is to think about whether you need to change your mouth shape to say the next bit of the word / the new syllable.
* **Phoneme**: phoneme is the smallest unit of sound. e.g. The word ‘chat’ is made up of three phonemes (/ch/ /a/ /t/), but only has one syllable.
